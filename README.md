# **Project Name**:  

Shopping Cart

# **Description**: 

The Shopping Cart app has the following features:
Features:
*  display pictures. Each time the Restock button is clicked, new pictures generate.
* Display item name, price, and stock count, along with an image.
* By clicking on the submit button associated with an item, the item gets added to the cart and the inStock number decreases.
* By clicking on the item in the cart, an accordian drops down displaying more info. By clicking on the accordian, the item is removed from the cart and the inStock number increases.
* The Checkout initializes with a total cost of zero. With each item added or removed from the cart, the total cost updates.
* Items out of stock cannot be added to the cart.
* Restock button clears all contents from the cart and returns the Checkout total to zero. All inStock numbers return to their original amounts, and a new image generates.

The Shopping Cart app project is an example of my ability to create a React app, employ Babel transpiler, and my JSX, Javascript, HTML5, and css coding capabilities, and as such, it is one component of my professional portfolio. This particular project is based off of similar activities I worked on in September of 2023 in modules 19-20 of the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."

# **Installation and Usage**: 

To run my project on your machine, download the files onto your machine or clone the repo. Navigate to the project directory in terminal. Start a server, my preference is using LiveServer in VSCode. I was prompted to type the command in my VSCode terminal: npm install jslint.

# **Dependencies**: 

The project relies on the following dependencies: React, Bootstrap, Babel


# **Support**: 

Please contact me via email at krentmeester@uwalumni.com.


# **Roadmap**: 

Future fixes or improvements that would be helpful to a user:

* The Submit button does not line up consistently. This should be fixed. It should not move and it should be in the same spot for every item.
* The way the user removes an item from the cart should be more obvious. I suggest adding a Remove button or icon instead of having to click on the accordian drop down info.
